# Sprint Ceremony Insights:

## Daily Scrum
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

From August 21, the first day we formed the team, to yesterday, our project
lasted a total of 49 days, and we held 49 scrum meetings without missing a
single day.

During the nearly 8 weeks of development, Daily Scrum helped us a lot.  Every
day, our team members could update each other,  understand other people's work
plans, learn from each other, and solve any obstacles we faced.


## Sprint Review
### Sprint 3 Goals:
- Connecting Front-End and Back-End
- Implementing Authentication
- Front-End Enhancements and Backend Testing
- Documenting and Evaluating Project Alignment

Sprint 3 is the last Sprint of this project. All the above goals have been
achieved on time. During the development process, although we also
encountered some minor problems, such as the integation
to the Paypal payment interface, all problems were successfully solved through
our efforts.

The workload we planned for Sprint 3 was proper, and the reserved flexible
resources were reasonable. In this process, we were even a little ahead of
schedule, so we saved some time to do the refactoring of the previous code.
