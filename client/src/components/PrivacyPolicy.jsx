            WECHAT PRIVACY POLICY Last Updated: 2024-04-12 SUMMARY Thank you for
            using WeChat! We respect your concerns about privacy and appreciate
            your trust and confidence in us. Here is a summary of the
            information contained in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").
            This summary is to help you navigate the Privacy Policy and it is
            not a substitute for reading everything! You can use the hyperlinks
            below to jump directly to particular sections in the Privacy Policy.
            DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO YOU? This Privacy Policy only
            applies to you if you are a WeChat user, meaning that you have
            registered by linking a mobile number that uses an international
            dialing code other than +86 ("non-Chinese Mainland mobile number").
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to you if you are a Weixin user.
            You are a Weixin user if you have either: registered by linking a
            mobile number that uses international dialing code +86 ("Chinese
            Mainland mobile number"); or contracted with
            深圳市腾讯计算机系统有限公司(Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems
            Company Limited) for Weixin. If you are a Weixin user, you are
            subject to the Weixin Agreement on Software License and Service of
            Tencent Weixin and Weixin Privacy Protection Guidelines and not this
            Privacy Policy. You can check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin
            user by clicking "Me" "Settings" "About" and then clicking the link
            to the "Terms of Service". If you see the WeChat – Terms of Service
            then you are a WeChat user. If you see the Agreement on Software
            License and Service of Tencent Weixin then you are a Weixin user.
            Alternatively, if you are using the latest version of WeChat, you
            can also check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by verifying
            the service name listed in the header at the top of the "Chats"
            screen. If you see "WeChat" in the header then you are a WeChat
            user, whereas a Weixin user will see "Weixin" (or "微信" for users
            viewing in a Chinese language interface). If you subsequently change
            your phone number (either from a Chinese Mainland mobile number to a
            non-Chinese Mainland mobile number, or vice versa) you will be
            required to convert your account (to either a WeChat or Weixin
            account, depending on your new phone number). If you convert your
            Weixin account to a WeChat account, this Privacy Policy applies to
            you from the date our system records such conversion. If you convert
            your WeChat account to a Weixin account, this Privacy Policy ceases
            to apply to you from the date our system records such conversion.
            WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU NEED TO PROVIDE WECHAT? When you register
            for a WeChat account, we will need your mobile number and an alias.
            You can further refine and populate your profile with additional
            information. If you use certain functions available within WeChat
            (such as posting photos to your Moments), we will process your
            information to provide these functions. More Information HOW DO WE
            USE YOUR INFORMATION? We use your information to provide WeChat to
            you, allow you to communicate with other users, allow you to use the
            features available on WeChat, and to improve and support your WeChat
            experience. If you are a parent or guardian who has granted
            permission for your child to use WeChat then we retain the contact
            information you have provided to ensure we can validate any requests
            or queries you may have in relation to your child's WeChat account.
            More Information WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR DATA WITH? We do not share
            your information with third parties, except where we need to in
            order to provide the service (e.g., SMS service providers) or if we
            are instructed to by a court, authority or compelled by law. We use
            these third party services solely to process or store your
            information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy . Any
            third party with whom we share user data is required to provide the
            same or equal protection of user data as stated in this Privacy
            Policy. More Information WHERE DO WE PROCESS YOUR DATA? Our servers
            are located in Singapore and the Hong Kong Special Administrative
            Region ("Hong Kong SAR"). We also have support, engineering and
            other teams that support the provision of WeChat to you, located
            around the world (including Singapore and the Netherlands), who will
            have access to your information. Rigorous internal control measures
            are in place to strictly limit access to your data by designated
            personnel. More Information HOW LONG DO WE KEEP HOLD OF YOUR DATA?
            How long we retain information for depends on the type of
            information – for example, log-in data is retained for up to 90 days
            from the date the data is collected. We do not retain your
            information for longer than the time period prescribed by law. More
            Information HOW CAN YOU EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR DATA?
            Depending on where you live, you may have special rights over your
            data and how we can use it. These include how you can access the
            data, erase the data, restrict how your data can be used, object to
            our use, and get a copy of your information. More Information
